                            GENERAL MIDI VERSION


 System Requirements:

  - MIDI playback software capable of reading Type 1 Standard
      MIDI File format
  - General MIDI sound device  (Wave Table or better recommended)



This Standard MIDI File was recorded directly from Sierra's "Zeliard"
arcade game.  It has been converted from the Roland MT-32 version for
playback on General MIDI sound cards.  A Wave Table or better sound card
is highly recommended for optimal playback.

Recorded/converted for General MIDI by Tom Lewandowski.  Address
