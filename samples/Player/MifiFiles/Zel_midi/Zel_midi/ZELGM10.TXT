                            GENERAL MIDI VERSION

 System Requirements:

  - MIDI playback software capable of reading Type 1 Standard
      MIDI File format and embedded SysEx data
  - General MIDI Sound Device (Roland Sound Canvas recommended)


This Standard MIDI File was recorded directly from Sierra's "Zeliard"
arcade game.  It has been converted from the MT-32 version for playback
on General MIDI sound cards.  A Roland Sound Canvas is highly recommended
for optimal playback.

Converted for General MIDI by Tom Lewandowski.  Address
